# Snakes with python

This is a simple snakes implementation using python outlined in [1] with help from [2]. The example file implements the example outlined in [2]. Python library dependencies are `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`. 

After cloning the repository, you should just be able to run

    python example.py

to see the example problem. After that, run

    python example2.py

to see a slightly more complicated shape.
